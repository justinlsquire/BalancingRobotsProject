The files in this directory (a-star.inf and pololu.cat) are the A-Star drivers
for Windows. To install these drivers:

1. If you downloaded the drivers in a ZIP file, extract it to a temporary folder
   on your computer.

2. Open the folder containing these files. Right click on "a-star.inf" and
   select "Install".

3. Windows will ask you whether you want to install the drivers. Click "Install"
   (Windows 10, 8, 7, and Vista) or "Continue Anyway" (Windows XP).

4. Windows will not tell you when the installation is complete, but it should be
   done after a few seconds.

For further information, see the user's guide for your particular A-Star device
on the Pololu website.
